# vehicleResources
This gives an example for how to add add-on vehicles as a resource to an alt:V server. You just need to copy the 'vehicle' folder (name it f.e. as which vehicle this is) into the 'altv-server/resources/' path and add the name of the folder between the brackets after "resources:".
