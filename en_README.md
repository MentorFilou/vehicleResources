# What is this?
This is an example documentation of an add-on vehicle in alt:V multiplayer.

# How to Setup
1. Copy the "vehicle" folder into your "resources" folder
('.../altv-server/resources/'). 
2. Rename it to anything you want (ex.: MANUFACTURER_MODEL).
3. Delete every example '.meta', which was not included in the add-on vehicle
you are adding.
4. Copy-Paste every '.meta' file from your add-on vehicle into 'vehicle/stream'.
5. Delete every example '.yft' and '.ytd' file 'vehicle/stream/assets/assets'
6. Copy-Paste the '.yft' and 'ytd' files from your add-on vehicle, which are
most likely named like the vehicle is named (filled in mostly into 'NAME' in
this repository) or very similiar if this is a vehicle pack (smth like 'NAMEa',
'NAMEb', etc.) into 'vehicle/stream/assets/assets'.
7. Delete every example '.yft' file in 'vehicle/stream/assets/mods'.
8. Copy-Paste every '.yft' file which you did not used in step 5 into
'vehicle/stream/assets/mods'.
